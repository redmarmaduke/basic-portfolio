                I was born in Napa, California and raised in the Central Valley as a first generation Portuguese-American.

                My interests include symphonic and marching music, computer graphics, all spicy foods of the Indian, Ethiopian,
                and Central American varieties; and certain types of computer games.  I cook some Indian dishes at home and
                unfortunately have to eat out for the other two cuisines.
                
                I used to play semi-professionally in symphonic and marching bands.  
                
                I enjoy computer graphics theory and have a toy ray-tracer written in C++ and Java.  The C++ variant can be compiled to run on CUDA 
                devices.  I am a fan of certain types of computer games including first person looters and massively multi-player
                online role playing games (MMORPGs).

                Additionally, I was a casual practitioner of Praying Mantis Kung Fu for approximately a decade under my late master Paul Eng.
